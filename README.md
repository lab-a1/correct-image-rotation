## Task

The task classifies the images based on its rotation. There are four possible rotations: upright, rotated_right, upside_down and rotated_left. The dataset used to train the model is available [here](https://github.com/lab-a1/correct-image-rotation/releases/tag/dataset).

[notebook.ipynb](notebook.ipynb) shows how the dataset is structured, the augmentation techniques applied and predictions made using the trained model. The trained model is available [here](https://github.com/lab-a1/correct-image-rotation/releases/tag/v0.0.1).
